An array in Java is a collection of elements of the same data type, arranged in contiguous memory locations. The elements of an array are accessed by their index, which is a non-negative integer that represents their position within the array.

Here's an example of how to declare, initialize, and access elements of an array:

// Declare an array of integers with a length of 5
int[] nums = new int[5];

// Initialize the elements of the array
nums[0] = 2;
nums[1] = 4;
nums[2] = 6;
nums[3] = 8;
nums[4] = 10;

// Access the elements of the array
System.out.println(nums[0]); // prints 2
System.out.println(nums[2]); // prints 6
System.out.println(nums[4]); // prints 10

In this example, we first declare an array nums of integers with a length of 5. Then we initialize the elements of the array with the values 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 using their respective indices. Finally, we access the elements of the array using their indices and print out their values.

You can also declare and initialize an array in one line using an array literal:

// Declare and initialize an array of integers
int[] nums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

This creates an array nums with the same values as in the previous example.

Arrays can also be used in loops to perform operations on their elements:

// Loop through the elements of an array and print them out
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(nums[i]);
}

// Calculate the sum of the elements of an array
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    sum += nums[i];
}
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

In the first loop, we use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the nums array and print out each one. In the second loop, we use a for loop to calculate the sum of the elements of the nums array and print out the result.

These are just some examples of how arrays can be used in Java. With arrays, you can perform a wide range of operations on collections of elements of the same data type.
